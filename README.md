 ## **Deployment Status 🚨**
⚠ This project is currently not deployed!
🔴 Deployment on Render.com failed.

## ** Why?**
- **Render.com does not support monorepo structures well (having both frontend and backend in the same repository).**
- **Render requires separate root directories for frontend and backend, which caused configuration issues.**
